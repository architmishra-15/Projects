# Data Visualization Repository

Welcome to the Data Visualization Repository! Here, we explore captivating visualizations related to the Gender Ratio of Indian States and World Population. Our creations are powered by popular Python libraries, including Pandas, Matplotlib, Geopandas, and NumPy.

## Project Structure

Explore my organized repository:

### Gender Ratio of Indian States:

- **Gender_Ratio_of_Indian_States.ipynb**: Dive into the data analysis and visualization code.
- **Gender_Ratio_of_Indian_States.py**: Access the Python script for the same analysis.
- [**Gender_Ratio_of_Indian_States.png**](./Gender%20Ratio%20of%20Indian%20States.png): The output image of our visualization.

### World Population:

- **World_Population.ipynb**: Uncover insights through the Jupyter Notebook.
- **World_Population.py**: Peek at the Python script behind the scenes.
- [**World_Population.png**](./World%20Population.png): Witness the captivating output visualization.

### CPI 2024 Data

- **CPI_Data_rep.ipynb**:The preserved data of how the code would look
- **cpi_data_rep**: The raw code
- **Output**: The output contains two image files; one is for [CPI of Rice](./CPI%20Rice%20Index.png) and the other is of [Inflation(%) of Wheat](./CPI%20Wheat%20Inflation.png)

## Libraries We Used

Our toolkit includes:

- **Pandas**: For elegant data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: Crafting static, animated, and interactive visual masterpieces.
