# *About*

Hi there you all, I am Archit Mishra. Here, I'll be storing and uploading the projects that I make. This will help me in keep a track of what I learned and show others about what I had made so that they can see and maybe provide with me with some important insights which would fuel my growth and learning even more. Though neither me nor my code is of that level yet that people could learn from it (hopefully in future it becomes), but if it can provide someone with an idea or inspiration for something, I'd be happy.

## *Project 1*:
   - My first project is a Password Manager. You can store your password that you used on a website along with the name of the website and its adress. Though at current it is completely mannual, but in future I'll try to make it automatic such that you won't have to open and enter everything yourself again and again. For now I've given a way to make a executable of the file so that one don't have to bother opening and IDE or terminal and running it from there again and again.
 
## *Project 2*:
- ### My second project is on Data visualization using Python. I've created various sub-projects inside it.
   - **Subproject 1:** *Visualising gender ratio of different states of India. The thing to notice in this project is the shape of legend which is curved from top and  bottom, unlike the traditional rectangular shape.*
   - **Subproject 2:** *Visualising the Population of different countries of the world. The shape of the legend is same as in first one.*
   - **Subproject 3:** *Visualising the Consumer Price Index 2024 for Wheat and Rice. The percentage of Inflation and Index.* 
## *Project 3*:
   - I'll try to make and upload Project 3 as soon as I can, please give me some suggestions on what I can make next. I am currently learning ML so most probably my next project would be some Machine Learning Model.
