# *About*

Hi there you all, I am Archit Mishra. Here, I'll be storing and uploading the projects that I make. This will help me in keep a track of what I learned and show others about what I had made so that they can see and maybe provide with me with some important insights which would fuel my growth and learning even more. Though neither me nor my code is of that level yet that people could learn from it (hopefully in future it becomes), but if it can provide someone with an idea or inspiration for something, I'd be happy.

# ***Table of Contents***

## ***Project 1***:
   - My first project is a Password Manager. You can store your password that you used on a website along with the name of the website and its adress. Though at current it is completely mannual, but in future I'll try to make it automatic such that you won't have to open and enter everything yourself again and again. For now I've given a way to make a executable of the file so that one don't have to bother opening and IDE or terminal and running it from there again and again.
 
## ***Project 2***:
- ### My second project is on Data visualization using Python. I've created various sub-projects inside it.
   - **Subproject 1:** *Visualising gender ratio of different states of India. The thing to notice in this project is the shape of legend which is curved from top and  bottom, unlike the traditional rectangular shape.*
   - **Subproject 2:** *Visualising the Population of different countries of the world. The shape of the legend is same as in first one.*
   - **Subproject 3:** *Visualising the Consumer Price Index 2024 for Wheat and Rice. The percentage of Inflation and Index.* 
## ***Project 3***:
   -  Project three is interesting because in this I've tried to do something new that I had never done before. Project 3 is mainly about animations. Though I am still learning about it, I'll try to make mrore fun and intriguing animations as I further deep dive into it.

   - ### The following are the contents in the Project -
     - ***Two Body Problem*** - The path of the revolution of two celestial bodies under the influence of mutual gravitational force.

     - ***Three Body Problem*** - A very well known problem in the field of physics and cosmos. The path of the three bodies revolving around each other under the influence of mutual gravitational force. Though it is quite difficult to exactly point predict their pattern and path, there are a few proposed solutions that were used for this project. With the help of the animation, we can see how chaotic it's nature is and is it so difficult.

## ***Project 4***:

- ### *This project can be use to download YouTube Videos via links.*
- This project can be regarded as a subproject, maybe? I mean yeah obviously it took time, effort and work to complete it and indeed it taught me alot but I wasn't explicitly trying to make this.
- Though now that it is made, it is my first project (and step) to have gui in it. I'll try to integrate GUI in the upcoming projects wherever it feels necessary to make it easy to use and navigate.
- I've also included an executable file along with it so that someone who don't have much knowledge of programming can access it too, I mean that's what programmers are for. :)

## ***Project 5***:

- ### *This project explores pointers in Python using C and Python's setuptools.*
- Implements a custom Python module that allows working with memory addresses, similar to C-style pointers.
- Key features:
  - Print the memory location of a Python variable.
  - Display the value stored at a specific memory address.
- This project demonstrates the integration of C and Python, showcasing low-level memory manipulation within a high-level language.
- Provides insights into Python's memory management and offers a unique tool for debugging and understanding variable storage.



## ***Project 6***:

### This project can -

- Convert the given image to numpy array and stores it in the `HDF5` file format (`.h5`)
- Can convert the `numpy array` stored in `.d5` format, back to the image.

> Tip :bulb: : Just don't forget the name of `dataset.`



## ***Project 7***:

**Comming soon...**

*Also please recommend me what should I be learning about next? I was thinking of making a project which would scrape the text review of something and convert it to a dataframe categorizing it in three forms - positive, negative or neutral. And would visualize that data*
